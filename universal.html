    <h2>Disclaimer: Unavoidable Common Knowledge Questions</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6;">
        Some questions in our Programming Quiz address basic and universally recognized concepts in programming languages, such as file extensions or commonly used syntax. While these questions may seem reminiscent of those found in various learning resources, they are integral to grasping the foundational aspects of the language.
        <br><br>
        We recognize that certain questions, like inquiring about the extension for HTML documents (".html"), are frequently encountered in educational materials due to their fundamental nature. Our intention is to cultivate a comprehensive learning experience by covering both fundamental and more advanced topics in programming.
        <br><br>
        Please be assured that the majority of our quiz content is meticulously crafted to present unique and diverse challenges that delve into the breadth and depth of programming concepts. We believe that an amalgamation of introductory and advanced questions will provide an optimal learning journey for all users.
        <br><br>
        We genuinely appreciate your understanding of the necessity of including these inevitable introductory questions in our quiz. Our mission is to provide an invaluable learning resource catering to both novices and seasoned programmers.
